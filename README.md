# JS-Smooth-Scripts-By-Br3tt
Made compatible with JScript Panel v1.2 &amp; Chakra Engine

-Download this file: https://github.com/19379/JS-Smooth-Scripts-By-Br3tt/archive/master.zip

-Browse inside the `JS-Smooth-Scripts-By-Br3tt-master` folder and extract `js_br3tt` to either `%appdata%\foobar2000`
 if using a standard install or the program folder itself using portable mode.
 
-Apart from fixing the badly formatted if/else statements that prevented it working with JScript Panel v1.2, nothing
 else has changed.
