# JS-Smooth-Scripts-By-Br3tt
Since JScript Panel `v1.2` makes use of the `Chakra` javascript engine when `IE9` or later is present, Br3tt's
original scripts on deviantart throw errors. This package has been created to resolve those issues.

-Download this file: https://github.com/19379/JS-Smooth-Scripts-By-Br3tt/archive/master.zip

-Browse inside the `JS-Smooth-Scripts-By-Br3tt-master` folder and extract `js_br3tt` to either `%appdata%\foobar2000`
 if using a standard install or the program folder itself using portable mode.
 
 -You then need to import the updated `main` script from inside the `js_br3tt` folder in to your panel.
